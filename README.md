# LLM and AIGPT Project

## Overview

This project explores **Large Language Models (LLM)** and **AI Generated Personality Technology (AIGPT)** using Jupyter Notebooks. The objective is to implement and fine-tune state-of-the-art models for natural language processing tasks and simulate personalized interactions.

### Key Objectives

- **LLM Implementation**:
  - Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-3.5) for tasks like text generation and sentiment analysis.
  - Fine-tune models on domain-specific datasets to enhance performance.

- **AIGPT Deployment**:
  - Develop personality-based chatbots or virtual assistants using AIGPT for interactive and personalized user experiences.
  - Experiment with different personalities and adaptability strategies based on user interactions.

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: Programming language for model implementation and data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for prototyping and documenting experiments.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Library for accessing and fine-tuning NLP models.
- **OpenAI API**: Integration for utilizing LLM models like GPT-3.
