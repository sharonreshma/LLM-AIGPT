This process, known as metastasis, is a key feature of invasive cancers and is often the cause of death in cancer patients.\\n\\nCancer can start anywhere in the body and is categorized based on where it begins and the type of cells it affects. For example, lung cancer starts in the lungs, while breast cancer starts in the breast. The cells can become cancerous due to a variety of factors including genetic mutations, exposure to certain chemicals and substances, or certain behaviors like smoking or excessive sun exposure.\\n\\nCancer symptoms can vary widely depending on the type and stage of the disease. Some common symptoms may include fatigue, weight loss, pain that doesn't go away, skin changes, changes in bowel or bladder habits, unusual bleeding, persistent cough, and difficulty swallowing.\\n\\nIt's important to note that not all tumors are cancerous. Benign tumors don't spread to other parts of the body and are usually not life-threatening. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, can invade nearby tissues and spread to distant organs.\\n\\nThere are various types of cancer treatments available, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, stem cell transplant, and precision medicine. The choice of treatment depends on the type and stage of the cancer, potential side effects, and the patient's overall health and preferences.\\n\\nDespite the severity of this disease, advances in cancer detection and treatment have led to a steady increase in cancer survival rates.

      "COVID-19 stands for \"Coronavirus Disease 2019.\" It is a disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China. It primarily spreads between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Symptoms can range from mild (or no symptoms) to severe illness. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Severe illness can lead to pneumonia and other complications which can be fatal.\n",

      "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—in order to \"learn\" from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize the accuracy.\n",

      "Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. This technology is used in various sectors like healthcare, entertainment, finance, retail, automotive, and more, often for pattern recognition, image analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and other complex computations. \n",

      "Deep learning models are built using various architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transformers, depending on the type of problem that needs to be solved.\n",

      "1. Corn: Corn is a warm-season crop that's sweetest and most tender when it's harvested in early to mid-summer.\n",
      "\n",
